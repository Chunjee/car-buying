# Notes on Oil Changes

Oil changes should be performed by yourself or a trusted mechanic; the risks associated with cheap "quick lube" shops is shockingly high and are often more expensive than anticipated after various upsells. Oil level should be verified before driving away if a shop is used.

Ideally, oil should be checked at least once a week, even more often when you are first getting to know a vehicle.

Stick to the oil capacity and weight the manual or manufacturer calls for. Do not use heavier weight oil.

If at all possible, replace the oil filter at every oil change. If the right filter is not available at time of change, ensure the next oil change is on time or early.

## Where and what to buy

#### Oil Filter
Oil filters for practically any car may be obtained for $2-5 at [RockAuto.com](http://rockauto.com); consider ordering three or so at a time to save on shipping. This is generally much cheaper than parts stores which start around $9.99 each.
If you are changing the filter at every oil change, the brand of filter doesn't matter much but some tested favorites are: ACDelco, WIX, Purolator


#### Oil
Any brand of oil is fine if the weight matches your engine. More expensive oils might be slightly better, but only marginally.
[Costco](https://www.costco.com/motor-oil.html) and [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=amazonbasics+motor+oil) have their own oil products that are better than average and cheaper than most.

## Change interval
- Min: 3000 miles
- Max: 5000 miles

Don't worry about going a lot of miles on one oil change, get the old dirty oil out and replaced as often as possible. Stick to the above intervals even if the manual says you **can** go longer, doesn't mean you should according to teams on the ground.

Sourced from [Car Wizard](https://www.youtube.com/user/OmegaAutoService):

> Modern engines today are not tolerable of neglected oil changes. **Really every three to five thousand miles you should be changing your oil**; I don't care what the service says on your dash

> Oil changes are pretty important on your car. With today's vehicles they use low tension piston rings in the engine; and oil consumption is actually considered normal even on a 2019 vehicle brand new. It might burn half a quart every thousand miles, that's not a whole lot. But if you let your car go ten thousand miles between oil changes, that's five quarts of oil that you used up.
