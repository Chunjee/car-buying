# Car Buying for the Average Person

## Who this is written for

Written for the average 16-30 year old working person who needs transportation without taking out a loan. In general, someone looking to spend $500-$6000

This will be covered in two sections. How to pay for it, and inspecting the car itself.

Throughout the page you will see anecdotes or reinforcements from other sources in the form of outside links or quotes. You should read through the entire page before clicking any links, as they will often lead to 15-30min videos that only serve to reinforce the idea already presented.

## Who this is **NOT** written for

This is not written for someone looking for a perfect car. This is not for someone who cares a lot about low miles. This is not for someone who has to have perfect paint. This is not for prettyboys who are getting a free $8,000 from mom and dad. This is not for you if you plan to spend a hundred hours searching and test driving till you find your perfect unicorn. This is definitely not for you if you think financing for more than 48 months is a good idea.

This is also not for extreme DIYers who want to put a $300 engine in a $500 shell.

--------------------
# Part 1: Budget

The first two things you need to decide when purchasing a car is:
- Budget
- Goals

An easy and widely accepted guideline, is not spending more than 10% of you annual income on a vehicle. For example if someone's taxes say they earned $29,000 last year (approx. $14/hour) then they should consider spending $2,900 or less, since the DMV and miscellaneous repairs are not free.

$50,000/year = $5,000 car. Notice something here? You need to be making 80k a year to afford that fancy $8000 truck! Do not fall for the trap of financing something you can't afford, [you are much better off saving your money and making a down payment on a first home than financing a $10,000+ SUV.](https://youtu.be/sQo4nzqYR50?t=290) You can absolutely screw up your ability to buy a house for years because your sedan isn't paid off yet.

> I highly recommend to anyone; avoid having a car payment, if at all possible. I'm on the hook for another three years and it sucks. Buy what you can for cash unless you're in dire straits.
<br>My old car was needing $300 repairs on a monthly basis for about five months, so for that amount of money I could have driven something new and far more reliable. That was my logic for buying my new car. Now, I still have over $8K in debt to pay off from it when I could have kept the old car and been debt free--even with costly repairs factored in I'm sure I wouldn't have had a $300 repair _every month_ for three, four, or five years.

> If you need to finance a car for more than 36 months; you can't afford that vehicle. Take a longer term, and you're going to be CAR POOR for years. Leave your ego at the door, and buy something CHEAPER!

Ideally the goal of the car should just be to get from A to B without incurring any major repairs in two or three years. But realistically you may have some other goals, like ease of carrying kids, cargo space, etc. Write down your goals before looking at specific models so you can make sure you don't end up with something that doesn't meet your goals.

## Gas mileage

Fuel economy should not be big concern unless you are using the vehicle for work like delivery or taxi. Do not get caught up thinking you must have a certain amount of fuel efficiency. Unless you are driving thousands of miles a month, the savings will be negligible. Saving $22 a month in gas is only $264 a year.

Hybrids are generally not worth the added complexity, if you are buying at this price range, the battery is likely near end of life. Almost all hybrids have an auto-stop feature that combines the alternator with the starter. So not only is the car starting-stopping more often, if that part ever needs replacement it could cost thousands.


# Part 2: Car Inspection

You want the car to be in good shape, but that's not the same as never been scratched. Learning absolutely everything to check for can take many of hours of study. This page, [this](https://youtu.be/6vZXLaP6Sok), [this](https://youtu.be/vyaNeKZjHcI), and [this](https://youtu.be/739IDmDSN6Q) can give you a good baseline. Ideally you would research all the known problems with the model and year you are interested in, but this often isn't practical if you are targeting a certain price, rather than a specific model.

Priority:
- how well its been maintained
- how likely it is to need major service while you own it (2-5 years)
- how good does it drive

Less-Important:
- how nice are the cosmetics
- how comfy is it


## Absolute Basics
Important things to check for when scoping out a car that also don't take hours:
- **Title:**				 The name on the title must match the seller's drivers license, or at least the last name if they are selling it for their spouse. If you are dealing with a salvage title, know how it works in your state. A salvage title is not popular but can be the source of a steep discount. If dealing with a salvage/rebuilt/etc title, you must [search the VIN on google images](https://www.google.com/search?q=2FTRX17213CA05298&tbm=isch) **and find** an image of the damage.
- **Blown head gasket:**     The ideal check would be performed with a [Block Tester](https://youtu.be/CHp5E7XnbXo). This can be impractical because some coolant may need to be taken out, and the car be warmed up. That isn't a super normal thing to do on a car you don't own yet. Checking under the oil cap can suffice in many cases (unless the seller cleaned it off recently). Check under the radiator cap while the engine is cold. Check for excessive white smoke in the exhaust after testdrive for further evidence.
- **Blowby:**                With the oilcap and/or dipstick off and the car running, check for blowby by holding your hand over the opening and checking how much air is coming out. Most engine designs will have some, but if it feels like the same amount that is coming out of the tailpipe, that engine is more on the worn side. It's not a walkaway, but you may not want to be spending $4000 or $5000 for it.
- **Transmission:**          Is the fluid red? Good. Brown or black may make you consider walking away depending on price and severity. Test drive and check if it shifts smoothly multiple times is the best you can do.
- **Exhaust:**               Hold your hand or leg up to the tailpipe exhaust. It should be very even for a 6cyl+ car. Should be basically even for a 4cyl. If it is putting or uneven, could just be a bad sparkplug, could be a bent valve, walk away.
- **Fuel Trim:**             Using an [engine scanner](https://www.amazon.com/LAUNCH-OBD2-Scanner-Universal-Automotive/dp/B07QLTYKDW), check for Long Term Fuel Trim (LFTF) on bank 1 and 2 (if it has a bank2). Should not go over +/-15% at idle. Should not climb when gas is held at 2,500 RPM. You will have trouble passing emissions if it exceeds +/-20% at any point. (you may see +99% if you floor the gas though)
- **Engine Codes:**          Using your scanner again, check for Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTC), check how far the car has driven "since MIL cleared". If the car was cleared of codes less than 200 miles ago, that is a good sign you need to walk away (or go on a really long test drive)
- **[Stop and Go miles:](https://youtu.be/yK7MXNaNGho)**     Check the brake pedal and drivers seatbelt for excessive wear. If the brake pedal is worn down to metal in any area, that is typically a walkaway in my book, but the price and other conditions can be factored in.



Less-Important:
- **Knocks or ticks:**       Using a mechanics stethoscope. Listen at the top and bottom of engine for uneven sounds. If suspect, inspect oil on dipstick for small glittering metal fragments. Noise at the top of the engine, while not ideal, are less concerning than noise at the bottom of an engine. A rattling timing chain is a walkaway.
- **Suspension:**            While test driving, turn the radio off so you can hear everything. Make hard turns, turn and hold steering at max left and right. [Using the car's open door, lever the vehicle up and down listening for noise.](https://youtu.be/ZGb51Od62t4?t=518) With a big press, check that the car absorbs the change quickly.


You should be buying something with a timing chain instead of a timing belt. A timing chain with decent oil changes will last 250k miles or more. A timing belt will typically costs $500+ in labor and is moderately difficult to DIY. Unless you can see the timing belt service on carfax or an old looking mechanics sticker; assume it has not been done regardless of what the seller says. If you know the engine uses a timing chain; you can ask if the **belt** has been done recently and the seller says yes, you know you are dealing with a liar. This is an easy way to catch car-flippers in less than 30 seconds, which is a walk away.
